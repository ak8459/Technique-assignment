# About
This project is a simple user management application built using React. It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user data by interacting with a simulated RESTful API provided by JSONPlaceholder. The application provides a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. Functionality View Users Display all users by fetching data from the /users endpoint. Show user details including ID, name, username, and email. Add User Allow adding a new user by posting to the /users endpoint. Users can input the required user details and submit the form to add a new user. Note: JSONPlaceholder will simulate a successful response, but the user won't actually be added. Edit User Allow editing an existing user's details. Fetch the current data for a user and populate the edit form with the existing details. Users can make edits to the user details and submit the form to update the user data via the API. Delete User Allow users to delete existing users. Send a delete request to the API to remove the user from the database. Error Handling Handle scenarios where the API request might fail. Show an error message to the user in such cases, providing feedback and guidance on how to proceed.
